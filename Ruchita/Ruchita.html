		I don't know how you became so important in very less time. This bond is very special for me because I never got attached with someone in a few days. Thanks to those ISL days where we started meeting formally for TT practices and special thanks to Pani Puri which broke the ice between us and then thanks to the VolleyBall which made our bond soo   strong. Last but not least, though Corona is the worst thing that happened in this year but this virus made our boring days worth remembering.

		You know what's special ? In this busy time when everyone is involved in some or other work but we somehow take out time for each other everyday. It feels incomplete if we don't talk in a day or two. I am very lucky bro to have met you. You are an amazing person with the loving soul and anybody would be so lucky to be able to even get to know you. If someone has crazy friend, they have everything so Always stay this crazy and keep farting your lame jokes.
